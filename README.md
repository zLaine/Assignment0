# Assignment 0 Instructions
This is a template and instructions for creating your own Assignment0.

_Please follow these instructions carefully, there are several ways to confuse yourself if you don't keep checking against these instructions as you go._

## Instructions

### 1. Use the green `Template` button above to create your own github repository. 

Click the green button, then click the blue "Create a new repository" button.

You will be using this template to create a _new_ repository in your github.com remote workspace.

### 2. Name it `Assignment0` when you create your own github repository from this template

If your github handle was `petecarapetyan` and you had a dark theme this is what your Assignment0 should look like now. Please notice that green `Code` button at bottom right.

- Now click that green code button and clone it with the `Open with Github Desktop`

### 3. Clone this down to your local box _**inside your coders campus workspace directory**_ being very careful to place it exactly there!


- Using github desktop is super dangerous if you don't pay attention to the folder that it clones your local repository into!!!!!

We spend a ton of time helping people find their projects because they didn't pay attention to this one part marked `DANGER!` so please try not to be that person.

Just in case you did screw up and put it in the wrong place here is how you hover over the local repository in Github Desktop to diagnose the problem.

### 4. Open your local Assignment0 repository in VSCode

You can view text and the Preview version at the same time by clicking the button show with the yellow arrow at top right

Resulting in a preview at right, like this:

### 5. Make changes

- a. Change `# Assignment 0 Instructions` to `# John Smith` substituting your proper name for `John Smith`
- b. Commit and push up to github using the lessons that Trevor gives you on Github Desktop. Refresh the github page, and examine to see if you like it (excepting instructions still showing).
- c. If you want to do the extra credit (see below), do that before the next step because you will need it for pathing help.
- d. Delete all the instructions text from this file.
- e. Push up to github again, refresh and examine.
- f. [repeat until satisfied with result per below.]

## Testing Your Assignment

If your github handle was `petecarapetyan` and your name was `John Smith` and you had your browser set on dark theme then this is what your completed `Assignment0` page would look like.

At this time, we do not review Assignment0, it is for your personal education only, so do not hand it in to the Assignments App like you would with Assignments 1-15

## Extra Credit

Learning how to path images (or any files, for that matter) is a frequent stumbling block for new coders. To illustrate this point, please examine this document and see how all of the images are pathed in this markup file, from the images directory. Such as `/images/complete.jpg` above.

For extra credit even before you will need it on Assignment 1, place a photograph of yourself in the images directory and make it show properly, such as below.

Hopefully your smile will look every bit as dorky as mine.

File path problems are very typical for most students in assignments 1 and 3. This is a good thing to learn early and get out of the way. If you don't understand how I got `/images/Pete.jpg` as the file path feel free to consult bard or chatgpt or any other AI.

## Should I repeat Assignment0?

This is something close to a 10 minute assignment once you get the hang of it. There is every reason for you to want to get this stuff into muscle memory early, because every assignment gets committed to github! 

You may save time, in the end, by repeating this assignment until it gets super easy and boring.

For example

- Assignment0b
- Assignment0c
- Assignment0d
- Assignment0e

You can d0 this as many times as you wish, you'll just have to delete the repositories from your github when they start feeling like clutter. Allow for about 20-30 seconds to delete a repository from github, once you learn it.
